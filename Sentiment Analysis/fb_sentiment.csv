I have downloaded roughly 90 books and only paid $7.00 total so far on books that were must haves.  I like having a variety so that if I am not that interested in a book I can choose another without going to the site.   I can always try that book again later.  This is fun.  I am reading again for the first time in a long long long time.  Thank you Kindle for finding a way that I can enjoy books now.  This coming from someone who never enjoyed any reading at all due to a mild case of dyslexia.,P

278,"Yep, its totally doable to download books to your computer than transfer to the Kindle via the USB cable.  People without wireless coverage have been doing it all along.

323,- Home page by CollectionUse your five way button move the cursor to the top of you home screen hit the right directional button and sort your Home page by Collection.

327,Thank you for these tips,P
328,"- Karen, Im guessing you mean book and not nook.  The nook and the Kindle dont interface.For a book, use your USB cable that came with the Kindle and attach it to you computer and reader.  Assuming here that you have a PC go to My Computer folder on your desktop and you should see a Kindle icon as if it was a USB flash drive or some other type of attached device.  Select the Kindle supported file(s) you have in your PC and drop them on the icon.  The files are now on your Kindle.",O

I did not mind paying that for favorite authors. I have 4 favorite authors coming out with new books this Spring and they are all $14.99. So, I will order these from my library. Ken folletts book came out this winter,$19.99. Seriously?? Ordered it from the library. I know this is the publishers and not Amazon. Netflicks says it will not mail out dvds starting in 2 years.

I waited for them through sports practices and other activities with a book in hand or in my purse.  The Kindle is a nice invention but I  think the whole omission of books entirely has gotten out of hand. Are we suddenly incapable of turning a page but only dexterous enough to keep clicking an electronic tab? Its nice to have access to many books but I personally read only one at a time. I cant think of anywhere I cant bring along either my Kindle or a book. ",P

614,I think the people saying holding a paper book is just as easy as holding a kindle WHILE HOLDING A FUSSY BABY have not tried it both ways. My son will only nap on me and the Kindle makes it SOOO much easier. You can do it w/1 hand....not so easy w/ a thick book (especially turning pages).

The warmth and sound of the reading would always calm him down.  As a result, hes always been a book lover.

625,"I find my eyes hurt after looking at the kindle screen for very long. I bought the official kindle light and it reflects off it. I cant imagine anyone being so ill prepared that they require an electronic ""book"" to have reading material available and would be last minute trying to find an open bookstore in the middle of the night. I donate my books as I read them to the library and less fortunate people who would like to read and are not able to purchase the kindle or the e-books to load onto it. I had no trouble raising kids without a kindle. Whatever enhancements it can add to the experience do not negate books entirely. A child would rather page through a colorful book and enjoy going back and forth to favorite pictures than a one page colorless screen. It may be 2011 but that doesnt make kindle available to or right for everyone. ",P

632,do that all the time,O
633,"Haha! I loved reading through these comments! I think what everyone is getting at - is that the Kindle shouldnt replace hard copy books entirely - it just provides a level of useflness that outdoes hard-copy books, hands down! Jogging on the treadmill, holding a baby, at the beach/in the water with a protective case, and then all the places and situations you could still read a regular book, but instead, youve got your WHOLE library, in 10oz and in one hand. Oh, not to mention you can bookmark, highlight, add notes, and you have a BUILT IN dictionary -- and you dont have to defile your book like you would your hard copy to put notes and highlights in. Hands down, the Kindle is better. How can anyone say it isnt better, when I can take my entire library, including my personal documents converted for free using my Kindle email/conversion process, everywhere I go - with a 3 week battery. I challenge anyone to carry your whole library with you for 3 weeks. Hehehehe!",O

Its good for both of our brains plus its like we have our own private book club!",P
640,I am there,O
641,"@Debbie: Id say the ease of managing kids & books at the same time  depends on what sorts of books youre trying to read. Slim novels would be easy enough to manage, but I suspect itd be tougher with a giant, pointy-cornered hardback.

645," I received my Kindle as a gift and appreciate the thought. I have a large collection of books in my home, have always been an avid reader, and enjoy sharing and trading them. Its less expensive. The Kindle is good for travel or other situations where it may be easier than carrying a book. Im glad to see people actually discussing and  sharing their ideas. Yes its the kindle site but Im not an amazon rep restricted to advertising the product and avoiding discussion of its pros and cons.  It has many good points but theres room for improvement. This is a good place to voice concerns and suggestions from which other readers may benefit.  For me, reading for too long off the kindle gives me a headache and  the $12 clip on light mentioned by somebody causes glare on my screen and eyestrain  despite angle adjustments. The effects are similar to  staring at a computer screen at length. If anyone has suggestions on how to correct this, this forum is the place to do it.  My eye doctor told me to limit or quit using the kindle and she said she hears the same complaint from patients often. Perhaps there is another alternative. ",P

675,It really comes in handy!!!!,P

686,I use the dictionary quite a bit. Dont know who uses some of these words. Love my kindle!!!,P
687,"I luv the Kindle, but the reality of the dictionary is that when it is really needed it is useless. A native English speaker should need it for the most esoteric words, and they are the very ones about which the dictionary stays mum.",O
688,"that tip does not work well with other languages btw. I installed a French dictionnary, but as soon as a word is plural, or feminine, instead of the standard entry in the dictionary, it no longer works. Very disappointing.",P
689,If only.the kindle was back lit!,O

694,SUGGESTION TO KINDLE - Id love to have a translation option. I have a series of novels that Im reading in English but the setting is Italy. They throw in Italian words and I find that I have to look up some of them. It would be handle if I could scroll to the word and get a translation like I do a definition.,P

706,Just tried it. Thanks for the tip. ,O
707,"Customer Tip: Kindle TOUCH. While reading, you can see the definition of a word by TOUCHING it. If the word is in the dictionary, the definition will appear at the bottom of your screen. See how much easier those instructions are?",P
708,I also change the default dictionary depending upon the book I am reading. The English dictionary for classic novels by Dickens or Doyle. American for contemporary novels by American writers.,P

716,"I love this on my ipad/iphone/computer kindle.  I would not usually take the time to look up a word, Id just assume a meaning by what was around it and go on.  Now, its so easy to tap it, and see the definition.  Love it!",P
717,"This is the one Kindle feature with the biggest gap between how cool it seems it would be (eh, it might be nice), and how cool it really turns out to be once you get used to using it (omg, how did I live without this).",P
718,"Kat,  while a touchscreen would be awesome, when you have a touchscreen its just one more thing to get scratched up and after awhile they do not work as well.",P
719,"I enjoy the dictionary feature so much that I missed it when I was reading a ""book"".  I had to have the Kindle near me just to look up words I wasnt sure of.",P

742,I use this feature often!!,O
743,I love this feature-I can read more technical books or special interest type and be able to understand the vocabulary.  This would be a great tool in a classroom if every student had one.  we can only dream of it happening!,P

782,I also love the dictionary feature. I used to just skip over words I really didnt know. Not anymore!!  It is great. ,P
783,Thanks for the tip.. Navigating to the precise word with the 5 way key is a pain... I wish I can type it in a the meaning just gets displayed!,P
784,"@Karen, yes you can do in on the original Kindles. You have to scroll the wheel up to the row where the word you want defined is, then push the scroll button. It will show you the definition for all the words on that row. ",O
785,The Kindle is worth it JUST for the dictionary. Unlike other readers you can access the dictionary on its own. And it is a pretty darn good dictionary too!,P

798,"OMG, I wish I would have known about this sooner! BUT, this is the coolest thing everrrrrr!!!",P
799,It comes in SO handy!!,O
800,"What an awesome feature. If I ever get one, I will use that for sure. Hubby teased me last night by acting like he was going to buy one for me & then changed his mind :-(",P
801,stupid Kindle people - I send PDF documents to be converted today & they didnt convert them & then charged me!!!  Have an email into them now...I already have the PDF format on my Kindle  I need a Kindle format!  I even put CONVERT in CAPS in the subject line & body of my emails - how much clearer do I need to be - it said CONVER to KINDLE format....grr...grr....NOT HAPPY!   NOT HAPPY at all...!!!,P
802,"I too, LOVE my Kindle!",P
803,뭥미??,O
804,I love this feature!,P
805,I love this feature. I use it all of the time.  I read a tree book last week I finally got that I had on hold from the local library for several months.  I kept trying to find my 5-way and look up words and the book was so darn heavy and inconvenient.  I was one of those that thought I couldnt get used to the idea of an e-reader because I like the smell and feel of real books.  Now I wouldnt do without my Kindle.,P
806,Sometimes the definition is at the top of the screen. Depends on where the word being defined is located on the page.,O
807,Very handy.  Use it all the time.,P
808,"@Barbara Evans, send the email to NAME@free.kindle.com instead of NAME@kindle.com to not be charged. I know theres some way to get Amazon to convert PDFs instead of just send them, but I cant seem to find it. I always use a software program called Calibre when I need to convert documents.",O
809,"As someone who LOVES to read but has a lacking vocabulary, I LOVE the built in dictionary. It really helped me get over one of my two major reading hurdles. Now if somehow the Kindle can make me read faster, Ill be all set :P",P
810,Another reason I love my Kindle.,P
811,"I still havent been able to archive my books when finished reading.  Any suggestions, Kindle users?",O
812,Oh yea I love my kindle and my IPhone kindle like one person said: Im Never without a book. JJ,P
813,"I found this feature to be so helpful while reading Georgette Heyer books... there are so many archaic phrases, etc..  Yay, Kindle!!Although I find if I go to a 2nd page of a definition, I cant find my way back to my book and have to close it and open it again. Duh.",P
814,This is a great feature,P
815,This is a great feature,P
816,"Ann- for archiving I made a collection and called it ""Read"". That way I keep track of books and know where Im up to, especially when reading a series. Or you could just delete it from your Kindle and it will be archived on your Amazon account for retrieval at a later date should you so wish. ",O
817,I use the dictionary feature all the time and love it EXCEPT when a word is spelled WRONG due to a typo :),P
818,I use the dictionary feature all the time and love it EXCEPT when a word is spelled WRONG due to a typo :),P
819,"page numbers are nice, also!",P
820,"I love the built-in dictionary, especially reading books by Lincoln Childs and Douglas Preston.",P
821,"I love the instant gratification of looking up words on my Kindle!  It is one of my top five favorite features.  I recently read a real book-- after keeping constant company with my Kindle since Christmas.  The thing I missed most about going back to a real book was the lack of instant definitions.  I tried keeping my Kindle next to me as I read, looking up words as needed, but somehowthis method lacks the finesse Kindle-reading!",P
822,All.  I gotta say is this is the best dang thing ever invented!,P
823,"Any chance to add a foreign dictionary?  Im reading ""A Child al Confino"" by Eric Lamet.  A wonderful book, but there are snippets of dialog in Italian and German/Yiddish.  Please consider expanding the dictionary options.",P
824,Im in love with my Kindle!!!,P
825,I bought the latest Tom Clancy in hardback form because Ive always collected his books. Havent finished it yet cause it is too heavy to hold. Im truly spoiled by my Kindle. Probably need to offer the hardback for sale & re-buy for Kindle. ,P
826,So luv my Kindle - one of the best gift ever received - luv all the features!!!,P
827,"Thanks for the tip, Ive only had my baby 4 days and love it already",P
828,I ´ m using it for every 20th word :),P
829,"Thanks for the tip, very useful :) ",P
830,I really appreciate this being posted so that I can have my Kindle in my hand while looking at how to manage it on fb. It really helped me.,P
831,"Minor niggle. It doesnt handle hyphenations well - such as sub-rosa. It will define ""sub"" but then skips ""rosa"" and goes on to the next word. But I love it all the same.",P
832,We love our Kindles here! My husband and two daughters have one!  My husband bought each one of us a new Kindle! I love this new reading experience!,P
833,"Built-in dictionary support is great but... You need to move cursor to the next world again through all page if popup definition is not enough and you need to jump to full world definition: select word - read popup - not enough - jump to full definition - return to page - current selection disappeared - move cursor from beginning of page to next word etc.Another discomfort: if page contains link to footnote, you need to move cursor to link through all page with accompanying word definitions popup. Too annoying :(Kindle need to have different page navigations for word definitions and links",N
834,This is the feature I use the most on my Kindle.  Dont skip a word you dont know.  Read the definition immediately to get more understanding from the passage.,O
835,I just keep hitting back button to get back to the page I was reading.,O
836,Can someone please tell me if you can read your Kindle in the dark?  Does it have internal lighting like reading on the IPhone does? I looked at the Nook and it does not and I need that feature. ,O
837,"Diane,All E_Inc books (AFAIR) does not have built-in lighting (or illumitation). You need to buy cover with built-in light or stand-alone light.",O
838,I really appreciate the enlarging font size. It makes night reading easier,P
839,Thats why I chose Kindle!,O
840,Love my Kindle!,P
841,Thanks for the tip. I will be using this one!!,O
842,So much easier than the way I was doing it.,P
843,I think posting these little hints is a great idea.  I know there must be things that I am able to do but have never noticed or figured out.,P
844,Thanks Kindle -- I love  you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,P
845,"And I love that feature...use it all the time, well, I should say frequently.",P
846,"I use this feature all the time.  Not sure it will help me learn, but it is nice to know what the word means in the moment.",P
847,"If Kindle could reach out and taser those bothering me while I read, that will be a good app.",O
848,"I too love this feature. Keep trying to find the dictionary toggle on my morning news paper, sadly it doesnt seem to have one.",P
849,I LOVE that feature!,P
850,"Ann light,  when you finish reading book remove book from device,it will automatically be archived when you remove the book",O
851,Didnt know that thanks.,O
852,One of my favourite features :-),P
853,I have cetatinly found the text enlarging useful as i have cataracts forming so the larger print makes reading easier.  I truely love my Kindlexxx,P
854,Easily my fav feature among many. Kindle simply rocks,O
855,I love the dictionary.  I have been using it for almost 2 years.  Its great when reading Twain or Swedish books.,P
856,Thanks for the info on archiving--Diane: re reading the Kindle in the dark: there is a cover that is lighted which you can purchase from amazon.,O
857,love these reminder tips!!!!!   keep them coming!,P
858,I love the dictionary feature!,P
859,"I use an inexpensive led light that straps onto me head with an elastic band, and runs on AA batteries. The light can be used for other things too, not just to light up me Kindle.",P
860,Luv my Kindle !!!!,P
861,Please make a Ukrainian dictionary!,O
862,^ Spam.,O
863,"could help them learn to read, wouldnt that be cool.",P
864,wow that was rude!! ,N
865,Does Amazon have a program to donate Kindles to developing countries?,O
866,i think thats the point... so they can learn to read...,O
867,"AMAZON - you need to get the junk off from here.  I know not to click on these links, but others might not.  Bunch of idiots.  As for India - they have most of our businesses now - not in favor of sending them anything.  Sorry!",N
868,Report PROFILE VIEWS TRACKER as spam so we dont have to put up with this all the time!,O
869,A great article........a great idea.......somebody should be sending Kindles to the poverty stricken regions of the globe. I love it!,P
870,Great story.  And he has a point.,P
871,lets make them solar powered first,O
872,"Andrea, that was my point too, lol.  Im sure the purpose is to help people read, if they were only donated to people who already know how to read then lets donate them to everyone.",P
873,"i think sending the developing world kindles would be an awesome idea!! it could help them learn to read, there are dictionaries on it to help, and they could communicate with people all over the world with facebook (i am posting this from my kindle 3) :D",P
874,Oh a solar powered Kindle would be great!!  Not only for developing countries but for our own too!!  Can you imagine not having to worry about losing the charger cable ever again???,N
875,"I too just returned from India - Southern India and the children were fascinated by the Kindle! A very poor country, where the people work harder than I have ever seen people work. While I love my kindle and think they to would love and enjoy one - they couldnt afford the cost of books or internet. The average salary is 5US dollars a day.",P
876,"It would also be great it the average US citizen could afford them. Kindles are awesome, but I work 2 jobs and I cant afford one!",P
877,Send my son a Kindle and load his school books on it to relieve his frame of carrying home 20 pounds of books and binder daily.,O
878,"Seriously Margaret? Do we just assume now that anyone in the ghettos of the world a.k.a ""developing countries"" cant read? As if your capitalized sentence didnt ooze sarcasm. How could you think that wasnt rude?",N
879,"While there are issues to work out (power, etc.), this was a very well written essay and I commend the writer for it.  Capturing the essence of a powerful experience is what world travel is all about.",P
880,@Karen God forbid your son should have to exorcise a bit. They want to give Kindles do people who have NOTHING and youre complaining about your son you want to be obese.,N
881,Id like to buy the world a Coke...and a Kindle. :),P
882,"Unfortunately I agree with Karen on the overly heavy schoolbooks comment, however they make Kindle formats of many textbooks now, so hopefully that will alleviate that stress soon.  As for sending Kindles to the modernizing world I believe it would be a great idea in theory and probably a horrible idea in practice.  I also believe there are greater concerns in those countries that we need to tackle first before sending them Kindles.",O
883,"@ C.j.:  Because that is what I do professionally...working for programs that teach illiterate adults here and abroad.  And in the developing countries, most of the adults are functionally illiterate--not their fault.  The capitalized sentence wasnt to ""ooze sarcasm"" at the people, but at the idea we can send technology and it will all magically be better.  Trust me on this:  learning to read as an adult is hard work, and only happens with lots of work by the teachers/tutors and the students.",N
884,"I think its interesting that there are so many that assume people in developing countries go not read. Did anyone read the post, one of the kids was more excited about reading off the kindle then playing around with it. What I took is that the kindle has the potential to renew the interest of the reader and create some excitement that for now a traditional book is lacking.",P
885,"@ John Tapley carrying books around causing back issues has nothing to do with exercise. If doing so made kids less fat, then why would there be fat youths still? Get over yourself. Textbooks on kindles would be great. Not so great for irresponsible kids (which is nearly all of them)",N
886,Get a better back pack and quit whining about the fact that SCHOOL KIDS have to carry BOOKS.,P

889,What a delightful and joyful article! I was in a very smart restaurant in Goa about 2 months ago reading my Kindle - the guy at the next table got out his iPad for nothing seemingly more than a bit of showing off. The waiters were fascinated by the Kindle and all wanted to play with it. They ignored the iPad.,P
890,What a brilliant article and idea!   I love my Kindle and learn something new every day I read it!  The dictionary would be so helpful and the text to speech would help in learning to read!  BRILLIANT,P
891,"God, what a great idea! With the need for books being so profound in the developing world, Kindles could be the answer!",P
892,"This would certainly benefit Amazon. LolBut really, it would be an inexpensive way to spread the wisdom of books.",P
893,"AGREE, AGREE, Agree if I could like this post a million times I would. Teach a man to fish! Not sell crap on Ebay. :-)",P
894,One of my sons has dyslexia. I would read books required for high school English into a tape recorder and he would listen to them. A Kindle would have saved so much time. What a blessing technology is! This is an amazing tool for dyslexics.,P
895,Not just developing countries. 25% of the American population is functionally illiterate. We have highschool graduates who can not read their diplomas. Does it get worse than that?,N
896,Id rather send comdoms.....or the pill,O

898,Stop buying textbooks for kids in school. Give them Kindles.,O
899,"They would benefit from decent medication, food and contraception first before a Kindle",P
900,Id like to see kindles donated to low income families and schools in the United States as well. There are children who dont have access to books everywhere!,P
901,@Erica pentz: yes! Fantastic idea!,P
902,"Im going to agree with Margaret on this one. The fact is that reading is a learned skill and there are many countries which havent yet learned it. Its just plain ignorant to think that there ARENT people who dont have this skill. And about the backpacks and textbooks on the kindle, its really an issue of publishers and copyrights and software/hardware issues. A device like (dare I utter it here?) the IPad would be able to handle such a purpose far better. ",P
903,Very interesting ... :-),P
904,Wait ....Bri...we can go on fb on the kindle...I need to find a kid for a lesson,O
905,AGREE!!!,O
906,Ive gotten almost that good of a reaction with my Kindle 1 at my husbands eye specialists office. Someone with very limited vision has their world opened again with the font changing option. I have been a walking advertisement several times personally. Kindle needs to direct advertise to ophthalmologists!,N
907,"How about sending this USA struggling author a Kindle? My book is available, on it, and I cannot see it.",N
